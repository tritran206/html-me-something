        <div class="content">
        <p>I was born from Vietnamese immigrants, in a Filipino refugee camp in Bhutan. At the time I was born, my parents were in the process of fleeing from our home country which at the time was in turmoil from decades of war. After years of moving from refugee camp to refugee camping we had finally made it to the great ol' USA, "The Land of Opportunity". Since coming to America, we have been moving from state to state looking for a break from the poverty my parents have been so accustomed to which came after arriving to Seattle, where my parents decided to live for it's incredible reputation for college education with their six kids in mind. I fell in love with Seattle and consider it where I've learned lifes greatest lesson. With the love for technology and what I can create and ideate to get translated into a technical platform I decided attend the University of Washington Bothell's Interactive Media Design program. There my focused was on UI and UX design, trying to find a ways make things convenient for the and intended audience. Shortly after granduating, my highschool sweetheart I were blessed with a beautiful daughter. I am currently studying programming to better utilize the skills that I have obtained as a designer. My goal is to find work as a full stack web developer.
